# Cubby - Notes for Claude

> **What Is This Note?**: The purpose of this file is to give Claude a place to read a round of tasks I have for development, formatted in an easier way than typing it all into the chat box. Here, it's all in one place. I will use the chat box normally, but sometimes I will ask Claude to reference this file for the next set of instructions. After completed, I will move the current set of instructions to notes-archive.md, so they can be referenced later if Claude needs, and won't confuse Claud in the future by still being here. If this is ever too many instructions or things to keep up with at once, please let me know. Feel free to take these tasks and make a copy of them to rewrite them in your own words, add checkboxes to keep track of what's been done and what hasn't, etc. Just make sure you copy and paste a copy of my original notes to notes-archive.md before you change them.

## Current Focus: Desktop Design Pass

Matt wants to build Cubby into a polished desktop browser app (+ mobile PWA), inspired by Asana and Monday.com. Reference screenshots are in `/screenshots/`. We're working through the desktop roadmap stage by stage — see `roadmap.md` for the full plan.

**Next up:** Stage 1 — Sidebar Polish

**Completed so far (Feb 14, 2026):**
- [x] Dual desktop/mobile layout (sidebar + bottom tab bar)
- [x] Center-aligned desktop content
- [x] Simplified mobile bottom nav (5 tabs)
